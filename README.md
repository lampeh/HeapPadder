## HeapPadder

Derived from the Memgraph mod written by Padishar.
Copyright (c) 2016 Gerry Iles (Padishar)


This mod is designed to force Mono to keep significantly more free space in the heap, which can significantly reduce the frequency at which the heap fills up and the Mono garbage collection causes a stutter,

## Installation
Copy the HeapPadder folder from the zip file into the GameData folder of your KSP installation.

Regarding the padheap.cfg file:
If the default settings aren't working well for you, try the following steps:

1. Increase the padheap size in your install: \GameData\MemGraph\PluginData\MemGraph\padheap.cfg, change the "total" number to 4096 
   or even 6144. See the next section for an example
2. For example, if you have 16 GB:
	a. Look at your task manager to find out ï»¿how much free ram you have when the game is running. 
	b. Do this calculation 16 Gb - ~5/6 GB from KSP - 1/2 GB Windows = 8 GB free
	c. This is the amount of RAM you can use for your padheap total size (in MegaByte 4GB=4096MB).  
	d.  Always have some Ram to spare of course. 

The mod has a default config file, called:  default_heappad.cfg.  This is needed only if there isn't a config file present, the config file is padheap.cfg.  If the config file is not present, then the default_heappad.cfg is copied to heappad.cfg.  This done so that any updates to the mod (highly  unlikely) will not overwrite any local changes to the config file
