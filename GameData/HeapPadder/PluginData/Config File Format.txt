The config file is laid out in a very specific format and order.  Any
change will cause it to not be processed, and a default set of values
will be used instead

The file consists of the following:

	Comments, identified by a pound (#) sign in the first column
	Blank lines

	Data, consisting of three columns of entries:

		First column is the block size
		Second column is a colon used to separate the data
		Third column is the weight assigned to the block size.

	Last line, with the word: total  in the first column, and a
	colon and then a final value

The block size is in bytes.  What happens is that space is added in 
chunks of space.  The size of the chunks determines how efficient the
space usage is.  Chunks too small will cause extra overhead, chunks too
big will waste space.

In general, I've found that only using block sizes of up to 208 seems to
work well.

The last line is the total amount of memory (in megs) to be allocated.  For
example, 1024 would be 1024 meg, or 1 gig.

The only line which will usually be changed is the last line.  Changing the
block allocation size is an exercise best left to others.
